# DNS Service Outage Incident Report

## Case Information
- **Case ID:** DNS-OUTAGE-082325
- **Date:** August 23, 2025
- **Analyst:** Analyst 1

## Part 1: Summary of Problem

The network protocol analyzer reveals a DNS service outage with multiple attempts to resolve the domain name yummyrecipesforme.com failing, with an ICMP error message indicating UDP port 53 was unreachable on DNS server 203.0.113.2.

**The UDP protocol reveals that:**
DNS queries sent via UDP to port 53 on the DNS server are failing to reach the intended service.

**ICMP error message:**
"udp port 53 unreachable"

**Port 53 is used for:**
DNS (Domain Name System) service

**Most likely issue:**
The DNS service on server 203.0.113.2 is not running or has failed.

## Part 2: Incident Analysis

**Time incident occurred:** 13:24:32.192571 (1:24 PM, 32 seconds, 192571 microseconds)

**How IT team became aware:**
Multiple customers reported being unable to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com with "destination port unreachable" errors.

**Actions taken:**
The cybersecurity analyst replicated the issue to confirm it was ongoing and not a local problem. Network protocol analyzer (tcpdump) was used to capture and analyze traffic during connection attempts.

**Key findings:**
- DNS queries to server 203.0.113.2 on UDP port 53 failed consistently
- ICMP error messages returned "udp port 53 unreachable" 
- Network connectivity to the DNS server exists (ICMP responses received)
- DNS service specifically is not responding on port 53
- Multiple retry attempts over 4+ minutes all resulted in the same failure

**Likely cause:**
The DNS service/daemon on server 203.0.113.2 has stopped running or crashed, preventing domain name resolution requests.
